Hello! I am a Professor of Mathematics at [Western New England University](https://www.wne.edu) in Springfield, Massachusetts, where I teach in the undergraduate and masters programs. Each summer, I serve as Director of [PROMYS for Teachers](https://promys.org/programs/for-teachers/) at Boston University.

My research interests over the years have been in number theory, algebraic geometry, and coding theory. In recent years, I have focused more on problems involving numerical semigroups.
