Hello! I am a Professor of Mathematics at [Western New England University](https://www.wne.edu) in Springfield, Massachusetts, where I teach in the undergraduate and masters programs. Each summer, I serve as Director of [PROMYS for Teachers](https://promys.org/programs/for-teachers/) at Boston University.

My research interests over the years have been in number theory, algebraic geometry, and coding theory. In recent years, I have focused more on problems involving numerical semigroups. Check out my [Publications page](/publications/) for more information.

I have grown increasingly interested in using [WeBWorK](https://openwebwork.org/) with the college courses that I teach. I have created problem sets for Calculus III, Differential Equations, and a course that we call Vector Calculus & Fourier Series. I have also created course notes for these courses. I am making all of this material available in Github. Check out my [Repositories](/repositories/) (or, currently, my repository) to see what's available.

This site is new as of May 2024. I hope to add more content/information soon.

If you want to get in touch, please email me at <caleb.shor@wne.edu>.
