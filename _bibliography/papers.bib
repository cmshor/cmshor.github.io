    abstract = {A free numerical semigroup is a submonoid of the non-negative integers with finite complement that is additively generated by the terms in a telescopic sequence with gcd 1. However, such a sequence need not be minimal, which is to say that some proper subsequence may generate the same numerical semigroup, and that subsequence need not be telescopic. In this paper, we will see that for a telescopic sequence with any gcd, there is a minimal telescopic sequence that generates the same submonoid. In particular, given a free numerical semigroup we can construct a telescopic generating sequence that is minimal. In the process, we will examine some operations on and constructions of telescopic sequences in general.}

In this work, we prove these facts and, more generally, give an integral formula for the proportion of \[ \lfloor (n-\nu)/1+\alpha\rfloor ,\, \lfloor (n-\nu)/2+\alpha\rfloor ,\, \dots,\, \lfloor (n-\nu)/n+\alpha\rfloor \] that are congruent to \( r \)&nbsp;modulo \( m \).
